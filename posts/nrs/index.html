There are neighborhood reports for Asthma, Outdoor air, Housing, Climate, and Active design. They looked like this, below: a list of indicators, neighborhood-boro-city comparisons, a trend, and a big colorful indicator about whether or not the chosen neighborhood is better, in the middle, or worse than most other neighborhoods.</p><figure class=figure><img src=/work-portfolio//old-data-portal-old-NR-output.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="The old EH Data Portal Neighborhood Reports."><figcaption class=figure-caption>The old EH Data Portal Neighborhood Reports.</figcaption></figure><p>But, there were a few problems:</p><ul><li>They were PDFs</li><li>Our site had more information about each of these indicators, but you couldn&rsquo;t click to explore them</li><li>It wasn&rsquo;t easy to go back and get a different report, or a report for a different neighborhood.</li></ul><p>Basically, classic PDF problems: the content doesn&rsquo;t really share the same environment as the rest of the site.</p><h2 id=formative-research>Formative research</h2><p>With the plan to re-design the neighborhood reports, we conducted formative research. First, we did a usability assessment, and identified some priority areas to fix: the new reports should be mobile compatible, be easy to use, and enable further exploration into indicators or other reports.</p><p>Second, we did user research, inspired and guided by <a href=www.civicservicedesign>Civic Service Design</a>. For this user research, we:</p><ul><li>Assembled a user group by reaching out to contacts we knew used the portal regularly</li><li>Distributing an open-ended survey asking for thoughts and ideas</li><li>Recruited 6 people for in-depth interviews in which we asked how they use data. Crucially, we weren&rsquo;t really asking them for their opinions on the site - rather, we were asking about their data-seeking habits so that we could brainstorm ways that the site could meet their needs and help solve their problems.</li><li>Recruited 6 people for a co-design session in which we collaboratively sketched out a re-designed set of Neighborhood Reports.</li></ul><p>This collaborative design session didn&rsquo;t get us there, however. But by synthesizing everything we heard, we identified a set of key problems and concerns:</p><ul><li>Yes, people want things to be easy to use - even expert data users</li><li>People - even health professionals - want us to provide context and explanation. The Why of an issue.</li><li>Users wanted to understand why a neighborhood performed the way it did, and wanted to be able to explore similar neighborhoods.</li><li>They didn&rsquo;t want to stop there - they wanted to think about what could be done about an issue, given the often problem-identifying lense of disparity data.</li></ul><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>Our team met weekly to help synthesize our findings, crystalize them into key questions, and rapidly iterate on designs that would address them.</p><p>Our intial-final design featured:</p><ul><li>Mobile functionality, which we sketched out using Bootstrap</li><li>Multi-step interactivity, allowing a user to get an overview first and details on demans</li><li>Connections to other reports, other neighborhoods, and additional indicator details</li></ul><p>There were some cool details, but some of them had to be changed or abandoned due to implementation constraints.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>We worked with a contractor to implement, and the design went through some further iteration. Once they were launched, they meet a lot of the original project goals: they&rsquo;re mobile compatible, they let us provide more information with the information we have, they allow a greater level of integration and exploration. And, we think they meet our user&rsquo;s needs, too.</p><figure class=figure><img src=/work-portfolio//new-NR-1.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="The new EH Data Portal Neighborhood Reports."><figcaption class=figure-caption>The new EH Data Portal Neighborhood Reports.</figcaption></figure><p>After seeing the summary output, a user can click into specific indicators to get more detailed information: neighborhood-boro-city comparisons, and other data displays: a bar chart, a trend chart, and a map.
