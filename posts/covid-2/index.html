In this time, I:</p><ul><li>Lead COVID-19 data visualization and data communication strategy</li><li>Managed and developed front-end web code</li><li>Trained and mentored analysts to do similar work</li><li>Authored and co-authored papers, spoke at conferences and workshops</li></ul><p>This project had wide-reaching effects.</p><ul><li>We built the Health Department&rsquo;s most high-profile digital product ever.</li><li>We brought our knowledge to the world, allowing it to influence research, policy, and pandemic response</li><li>We raised the profile of the importance of smart, strategic data communication in the department</li><li>We advised people in other jurisdictions' health agencies on how to do similar work</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s what we tried to do with the COVID-19 data pages:</p><h2 id=lightweight-easy-technology>Lightweight, easy technology</h2><p>When we started, we wanted to build something that we could launch in <em>days</em>. That means choosing very lightweight technology. We started with a free Datawrapper account and a free Github account.</p><h2 id=a-maintainable-workflow>A maintainable workflow</h2><p>We&rsquo;d be updating the data every day, and we didn&rsquo;t know how long it would last - maybe months! We needed a workflow that was simple, and easy for new staff coming in to emergency response work to pick up. Feeding the charts from a Github repository meant that an analyst would only have to run the code that updated our local CSVs and then upload them to Github - that would update all of our data pages.</p><h2 id=publish-data-as-data>Publish data as data</h2><p>Government agencies are often notoriously bad at publishing data, often formatting it as web content, or burying it in PDFs. We wanted to make it easy for researchers, journalists, and others to use the data - so we committed to publishing them in machine-readable CSV format.</p><h2 id=be-transparent>Be transparent</h2><p>Early on, we&rsquo;d know that the data would change. Early in the pandemic, people noticed that data for prior days would adjust upward: we were pubilshing data by date of diagnosis, meaning that if yesterday, we learned about a new case a week ago, then the count for the date a week ago would go up. This was new to much of our audience, and we fielded a lot of questions about why &ldquo;old data&rdquo; were changing.</p><p>Additionally, analytics and informatics methods were being developed on the fly. These surely would change, and that would change data values, too. We knew that this could freak people out or look like manipulation or suppression, so we wanted to be fully transparent about it.</p><p>Publishing data in a Github repository meant:</p><ul><li>People could see the historical record, via previous versions stored by git</li><li>We could include a lot of documentation, data definitions, and more</li><li>People could ask questions by filing issues - and we&rsquo;d answer them</li></ul><h2 id=make-the-data-friendly-and-approachable>Make the data friendly and approachable</h2><p>Data aren&rsquo;t just for data professionals. Data are knowledge, and we wanted to share that widely. So we wanted to make the data accessible for many kinds of people, regardless of data literacy. To do this, we:</p><ul><li>Built data pages as standard webpages, rather than as technical-feeling &ldquo;dashboards&rdquo;</li><li>Created communication-oriented visualizations, frequently departing from design and visualizations standards common to research, academic or biomedical data analysis. We built clear, focused, message-oriented visuals.</li><li>Explained metrics, interspersing visuals with explanations of the metrics they were showing, what they mean and why they are important.</li></ul><h2 id=listen-to-users>Listen to users</h2><p>To ensure that we were meeting our targets, we listened to our users. We monitored the Issues in the Github repository, kept tabs on data conversations on Twitter, conducted informal usability research and sitewide surveys. We&rsquo;d synthesize what we learned and fold in our findings into new development plans.</p><h2 id=adapt>Adapt</h2><p>The pandemic changes, so our data reporting had to, too. We aimed to stay flexible and adaptible, with a &ldquo;continuous improvement&rdquo; approach whereby we might prototype and launch something but aim to refine and improve it as it was live, rather than being late trying to get it perfect the first time.</p><p>And, we planned to modify the data and what we were displaying as needs dictated, rather than assuming that the needs wouldn&rsquo;t change as the pandemic did.</p></div></div></div><div class=row></div></div><footer class="footer text-white bg-dark"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="offset-lg-1 col-lg-10 col-xs-12"><p class="text-center my-4 pa-0">&copy; 2022</p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/assets/js/script.js></script></body></html>
