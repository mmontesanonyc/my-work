I coordinated work on its Data Access Portal, working with epidemiologists, GIS professionals, and developers.</p><p>This was my first experience working with web content about public health data, and I had something of a revelation. I reflected on my previous experience as a plain language health writer, and as a nonprofit proposal writer - both of these were about writing so that your audience would <em>do</em> something in response, either change a health behavior, or fund a nonprofit. I realized that design techniques played a role, too - and I learned about web usability and data visualization design. All of these overlapped in my head and I began to think about how web design, usability, data vis design, and plain language could all work together to create effective data communications.</p><h2 id=user-research>User research</h2><p>Early in my work, I convened user groups to conduct usability tests of the site. I was inexperienced with usability research, but read as much as I could and learned a lot from <a href=www.usability.gov>Usability.gov</a>. Over the course of many months, I convened several different groups and did a variety of usability tests.</p><p>The findings were incredibly valuable, and helped build a case that in order to make the most of our valuable data and information, we needed to have a functional design that supported the information.</p><h2 id=re-design>Re-design</h2><p>When I started work on the site, it was built in the department&rsquo;s standard page contexts, with confusing navigation. In usability tests, I watched users accidentally wander off into other sections of the department&rsquo;s website, not realizing that they had left &ldquo;this system.&rdquo; This is a problem.</p><p>We felt it was important to delineate the borders of the site. Our re-design featured:</p><ul><li>A new logo and fresh Bootstrap theme developed in partnership with the department&rsquo;s communications staff and our developer</li><li>Mobile compatibility</li><li>Simplified navigation</li></ul><p>Additionally, to ensure that the content was in line with the new design, I developed and implemented new content standards: organizing information under headers and bullets, incorporating plain language summaries, and using message-focused visualiation techniques.</p><figure class="figure px-4"><img src=/my-work//MN-portal-screenshot.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A small snip of the Portal redesign." style="box-shadow:10px 10px 5px lightgray"><figcaption class=figure-caption>A small snip of the Portal redesign.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=county-profiles>County profiles</h2><p>After a demonstration at a local department of health, one worker said to me, &ldquo;I use the site to go get data for our county. That means that I go to one section, query the data, and pull the data for our county - and then I go to another section, query the data, and pull the data for our county. It would be great to be able to pull data just for my county.&rdquo;</p><p>It was an &ldquo;ah ha/of course!&rdquo; moment. I began designing the County Profiles, worked with our in-house developer to develop them, and launched MDH&rsquo;s first county data profiles.</p><figure class="figure px-4"><img src=/my-work//MN-countyprofiles-small.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A small snip of the County Profiles." style="box-shadow:10px 10px 5px lightgray"><figcaption class=figure-caption>A small snip of the County Profiles.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=governors-award>Governor&rsquo;s award</h2><p>Our program manager, Chuck Stroebel, submitted our program for a Minnesota Governor&rsquo;s Award in 2013 - and we won, <a href=https://mn.gov/admin/continuous-improvement/results/sga/>one of 6 recipients that year who created Better Government Services</a>. There was a gala at the statehouse. We met Governor Dayton, and on my way out I accidentally walked by <a href=https://www.mnhs.org/capitol/learn/art/8912>the fairly ridiculous portrait of Jesse Ventura</a>.</p><figure class="figure px-4"><img src=/my-work//2013-mn-gov-award.jpeg class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Our team, with the Governor." style="box-shadow:10px 10px 5px lightgray"><figcaption class=figure-caption>Our team, with the Governor.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=row></div><div class=row><div class="col-1 mx-auto"><i class="fa-solid fa-asterisk pl-3 text-info" style=font-size:200%></i></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-white bg-dark"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="offset-lg-1 col-lg-10 col-xs-12"><p class="text-center my-4 pa-0">&copy; 2022</p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/my-work/assets/js/script.js></script></body></html>
