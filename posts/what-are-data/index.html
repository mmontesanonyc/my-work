The company, she told me, does semiotics-related research: understanding cultural meaning and associations to help other companies develop brand strategies.</p><p>She told me that it is a storytelling-heavy environment, where a good pull quote is likely to be more powerful than a datapoint. And, she asked me to speak about data storytelling. Here&rsquo;s some of what I said:</p><h2 id=data-are-stories>Data are stories</h2><p>Data have a reputation for being cold and clinical, and people who work with it have a reputation for being lifelessly preoccupied with objective fact. But, data are stories – and they play an important role in our society.</p><p>Many years before the pandemic, I went to a talk about risk and crisis communication in which the speaker presented the country&rsquo;s experience with two different viruses:</p><figure class="figure px-4"><img src=/my-work//virus-comparison.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Comparing virus numbers." style="box-shadow:10px 10px 5px lightgray"><figcaption class=figure-caption>Comparing virus numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>What were these viruses? Virus A is ebola, which captured people&rsquo;s fears. Virus B is the flu, which causes many people to shrug. But you can see that there&rsquo;s an uneven relationship between the risk each posed and the fear it instilled.</p><figure class="figure px-4"><img src=/my-work//dumb-and-dumber.png class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="From the movie Dumb and Dumber." style="box-shadow:10px 10px 5px lightgray"><figcaption class=figure-caption>From the movie Dumb and Dumber.</figcaption></figure><p>The things we’re afraid of is often very out of step with the things that pose a real risk to us. This is hardwired into our brains. We’re susceptible to good stories, especially ones that match our preconceived notions. Or, sometimes when things are new, vivid, and scary, we are prone to confuse the exception with the norm.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/nyregion/deaths-expose-chaos-of-central-parks-loop.html>Here’s a 2014 New York Times article</a> about <em>deaths exposing chaos</em> among cyclists and pedestrians in Central Park. It’s scary and new and tells a good story.</li><li>But data can help us put this into perspective. <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-02/the-rate-of-pedestrians-injured-by-bicyclists-is-going-down>Bloomberg&rsquo;s CityLab reports on how actually, despite 2 deaths, rates of injuries are going down, even as the number of cyclists rises</a>. Here, data are providing the big story – the big picture – the context – the perspective.</li></ul><p>This matters, because we’re wrong a lot: we’re susceptible to false stories, and we can easily become afraid of very, very unlikely scenarios. This can have consequences - say, for example, when a demagogue harnesses that fear that to rise to a terrifying amount of power.</p><h2 id=when-people-look-for-data-theyre-not-looking-for-numbers>When people look for data, they&rsquo;re not looking for numbers</h2><p>Data are stories, and when people look for data, they&rsquo;re not just looking for numbers. In March 2020, I recall seeing many people on social media trying to get reliable data on the growing COVID-19 outbreak in NYC. Everyone, it seemed, was anxiously asking for data that would explain the changing world around them.</p><p>They wanted to access data – but they weren’t looking at data to get the data. They were looking to data for reassurance that the government was on top of things and acting in their best interest; they were looking to understand whether they were at risk, and how much – they were trying to calibrate their fear. I was.</p><p>The bottom line is that the number itself didn’t matter – what mattered was why people were looking for that number, and what it meant to them to find it.</p><hr><p>Here&rsquo;s another example. I have asthma, and I live in Flatbush. If I look up data on adult asthma in Flatbush, I might find that there are <strong>123.7 asthma emergency department visits per 10,000 people in Flatbush.</strong> Which begs the question: so what?</p><p>This doesn’t help me – and it doesn’t help most people. When people are looking up asthma data by neighborhood, they’re not looking for the number. They’re looking for an assessment: is my neighborhood better or worse than other neighborhoods? And why? What’s causing it?</p><hr><p>In my work, we observe this when doing user research. In talking to a wide variety of people - be they data analysts, community organizers, or just concerned citizens - people tell us the same thing. They want data, but more than that, they want <strong>more than the what</strong> - they want <strong>the why.</strong></p><p>In short, people are looking for a story. They’re looking for comparison, context, and explanation. And data are a way to ground that story, and provide that, but it doesn’t just come from a number. It comes from how we situate and communicate the numbers. How we give them meaning.</p><h2 id=data-are-social-products>Data are social products</h2><p>While some people view data as objective truths, it makes a lot more sense to contextualize data – they’re social products, so their context matters a lot.</p><p>Data don’t say anything on their own. Rather, their whole lifecycle of how they were generated, who’s responsible for them, and who’s using them to say what – all of that matters.</p><p>A few examples:</p><h3 id=garbage-in-garbage-out>Garbage in, garbage out</h3><p>In 2018, <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G>Amazon made headlines</a>. They had been applying machine learning to their recruitment and hiring process, and they wanted their algorithm to take in resumes and spit out the most qualified candidates.</p><p>But their machine-learning algo had learned that Amazon was more likely to hire men than women. So the algorithm was downgrading the resumes of women. Yes, it was producing data, but those data weren’t objective truths – they were products of the material culture that surrounded them and produced them. The algorithm took in garbage – data on biased processes – and recycled it: “garbage in, garbage out.”</p><p>Similarly: some police departments use &ldquo;predictive policing software&rdquo; to guide deployment. <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11757>It assumes that all people are potential criminals, except for police</a>; it assumes that when police are present somewhere, they only do good; and based on these assumptions, it guides police deployment. It tends to deploy police areas where there have been arrests in the past. It’s easy to see how they perpetuate systemically racist policing – laundering previous bias into so-called “objective data.”</p><h3 id=maintaining-racial-segregation>Maintaining racial segregation&mldr;</h3><p>Walter Plecker was a segregationist in the early 20th century who worked for Virginia’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. By re-writing racial categories in the data, he re-shaped segregation in the state for a long time.

They&rsquo;re social tools that can be used for or against established powers.</p><h2 id=communicating-data-is-a-social-process>Communicating data is a social process</h2><p>I like to say is that most people can no more understand data by looking at numbers than they can hear a song by reading music. Translating numbers to meaning is where data visualization and communication step in.</p><p>Fundamentally, just giving somebody information doesn’t ensure that they learn it – it must be structured and designed in ways that people can more easily make sense of, designed to teach them, and remove barriers to understanding. There’s even research that <a href=https://psyarxiv.com/dnr9s/>people trust nicer-looking visualizations more</a> – and, perhaps, learn more from them.</p><p>Data are often perceived to be cold and complicated – but data communication is a social process and there are social and cognitive realities that we can address – that can change how they’re perceived. By this I mean that we can take data out of the “for experts only” realm and make them accessible to all.</p><p>We can harness findings from other fields - design research and human-centered design, web usability, and health communications - to design data visualizations to communicate to all sorts of people, from lay to expert. In some of my work, we’ve designed data products specifically for people who “aren’t” interested in data, and it works – these products get pageviews, they score well with users, and they drive traffic to other resources.</p><p>All in all, data act like other pieces of information: the form is part of the function. Content, medium, structure, design all work together, and they create a complex ecosystem of information.</p><h2 id=data-communication-is-truth-telling>Data communication is truth-telling</h2><p>This is where things get handwavey, so I&rsquo;ll keep it brief. We live in a country full of misinformation, disinformation, and alternative facts. There&rsquo;s a lot of mistrust - of other people, of government, and so on.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a role for clear and accessible truth-telling - especially from government. Making things better and making things easier can play a role in repairing or rebuilding our society. Maybe this starts with rebuilding trust - and if it does, it&rsquo;s clear to me that making our knowledge accessible and understandable is a necessary component.</p><p>We need data to help us tell big truths - and we need to do it well to earn the trust that we want.</p></div></div></div><div class=row></div><div class=row><div class="col-1 mx-auto"><i class="fa-solid fa-asterisk pl-3 text-info" style=font-size:200%></i></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-white bg-dark"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="offset-lg-1 col-lg-10 col-xs-12"><p class="text-center my-4 pa-0">&copy; 2022</p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/my-work/assets/js/script.js></script></body></html>
