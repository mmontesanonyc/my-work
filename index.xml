I like to talk about things like:
What we&amp;rsquo;re doing to make public health data more accessible Why it&amp;rsquo;s important for public health agencies to focus on how they communicate data How to do data communication well: research, practices, and methods Where data visualization, design, web usability, and health comms overlap Specific projects: our research, our problems, our solutions, and our results 2022 &amp;ldquo;Effective Data Communication.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/about/</guid><description>About me Currently, I am the Director of Data Communication in the Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. In this role, I:
Lead work on the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal Conduct user research Create new digital interactive web products In this role, I&amp;rsquo;ve overseen a dramatic expansion of the EH Data Portal, launching a data stories initiative, designing a suite of interactive one-page data applications, and overseeing a major re-design and re-build of our full site.</description></item><item><title>Old work</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/other/old-work/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/other/old-work/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some old work.</description></item><item><title>Data Portal Redesign Part 1: Problems and Priorities</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/portal-redesign/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/portal-redesign/</guid><description>In 2021, our team began a re-design of the Environment and Health Data Portal. This site is one of the Health Department&amp;rsquo;s marquee data communication platforms. The site was designed to store and automatically visualize datasets (&amp;ldquo;indicators&amp;rdquo;) that show how environments and heath are related.
The old EH Data Portal. The portal&amp;rsquo;s original functionality, automatically visualizing a dataset, became called the Data Explorer. Here&amp;#39;s an example. &amp;times; Visualization of an indicator Close</description></item><item><title>Automating Updates</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/automating-updates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 10:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/automating-updates/</guid><description>Heat syndrome My climate colleagues approached me to talk about a page that would provide near realtime data on temperature and heat-related illnesses.
I built a simple page that showed charts with the data. My colleagues automated an R script to output the files and a bash script to push the files to the Github repository. The charts were built to read the data in the Github repo. So, without intervention, this page updates every day.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Interactives</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/js-interactives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/js-interactives/</guid><description>Air Quality Explorer In 2019, I was learning about our air quality research team, and what they learn from the NYC Community Air Survey.
I learned that they sample air quality each season from nearly 100 locations around the city, and combine those readings with data on things like building density and emissions, traffic, industrial activity, and more. This lets them create a complex model that can predict air quality in unmonitored areas, based on what they know about all the other underlying factors.</description></item><item><title>Re-designing Neighborhood Reports</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/nrs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 10:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/nrs/</guid><description>The EH Data Portal&amp;rsquo;s Neighborhood Reports were designed to show data for a neighborhood on a a specific environmental health topic. There are neighborhood reports for Asthma, Outdoor air, Housing, Climate, and Active design. They looked like this, below: a list of indicators, neighborhood-boro-city comparisons, a trend, and a big colorful indicator about whether or not the chosen neighborhood is better, in the middle, or worse than most other neighborhoods.</description></item><item><title>Data Stories</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/data-stories/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/data-stories/</guid><description>In 2019, early in my work on the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, our team was looking for some novel ways to communicate our data.
The problem Our bureau was full of amazing researchers doing fascinating work. Our EH Data Portal was there to serve them. How could it best shine a light on their work?
Making datasets available is helpful, but the data itself is just the tip of the iceberg about what we know about a topic.</description></item><item><title>Philadelphia Immunization Program</title><link>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/immz-comms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:14:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mmontesanonyc.github.io/work-portfolio/posts/immz-comms/</guid><description>In 2017 - 2018, I was the Communications Lead with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health Immunization Program.
