In 2019, early in my work on the Environment & Health Data Portal, our team was looking for some novel ways to communicate our data. 

## The problem
Our bureau was full of amazing researchers doing fascinating work. Our EH Data Portal was there to serve them. How could it best shine a light on their work? 

Making datasets available is helpful, but the data itself is just the tip of the iceberg about what we know about a topic. And, our users tell us that there’s something they want more than data: **they want us to tell them what the data mean.** 

What we know is not always reflected in the data, and not everybody can look at the same dataset and see the same things or draw the same conclusions, So, we needed content to describe:
- Why this is the way it is
- What most affects it
- What we do or don’t expect to show up in the data, and why

## The approach
We began a project to write **data stories**.

Data stories are a consumable entryway into a dataset, complex topic, or academic paper. They are a snack in a bite/snack/meal structure, and can be an easy-to-read overview of a full topic.
- They use data to explain topics. They don’t just report results - they provide insight into a health topic.
- They tell people what to look for or what to know about a topic - offering a sense of “the why” of an issue.
- Make connections across different areas - how one thing might affect another. 
- Offer our expert perspective - how we view an issue, how it fits into public health as a whole.

We wrote data stories to link to data that we have on the EH Data Portal (or link to published papers; or refer to indicators that are related to the topic of the story). But, they also bring in other data points, and make broader connections to describe an issue in ways that data alone cannot.

- Focus on a few key pieces of data that show meaningful connections or changes (rather than comprehensive data with a low signal-to-noise ratio). It’s ok to “cherrypick.”
- [Declutter and focus visualizations](https://visualthinking.psych.northwestern.edu/projects/DeclutterFocus/Ajani_Declutter_2021.pdf); use [evidence-based visualization techniques](https://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EvergreenDataVizChecklist.pdf). 
- Write content that introduces, supports, and explains what’s going on in those visualizations.
- Use [storytelling conventions](https://nightingaledvs.com/how-to-use-storytelling-conventions-to-create-better-visualizations/), if possible: balance, crisis, journey, climax.
- Use an informal tone: write as we (we, the Health Department), and address the audience as you.

## The successes
We published 20 data stories in about 3 years. [They are available here](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Infographic.aspx). They covered topics like asthma, air quality, violence, racism in the housing market, the COVID-19 shutdown, street safety, and climate justice. 

In those 3 years, the data stories received nearly 40,000 pageviews (representing about 5% of the site's web traffic), with high time on page. They provided an entry point to the rest of the site for many users and contributed to the Portal's significant traffic growth.
