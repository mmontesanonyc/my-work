I spent 27 months activated with the Health Department's COVID-19 response, working on our data webpages. In this time, I:
- Lead COVID-19 data visualization and data communication strategy
- Managed and developed front-end web code
- Trained and mentored analysts to do similar work
- Authored and co-authored papers, spoke at conferences and workshops

This project had wide-reaching effects. 
- We built the Health Department's most high-profile digital product ever. 
- We brought our knowledge to the world, allowing it to influence research, policy, and pandemic response
- We raised the profile of the importance of smart, strategic data communication in the department
- We advised people in other jurisdictions' health agencies on how to do similar work

## Initial push
In March 2020, after a few days regularly refreshing the Health Department's webpages, I began building a prototype of a COVID-19 data webpage. I would grab the numbers that the Department reported each day via a PDF, add them to a Github repository I was assembling, and visualize them on a page that I was building. 

After a week of this, I sent my prototype around to a few people, and shortly thereafter was asked to join a team that would do this officially for the agency. This interdisciplinary team had epidemiologists, analysts, data communication specialists, and web editors. In a week or two, we designed, built, and got approval to launch a COVID-19 webpage, using technology and strategies that the Health Department had never used before. 

The initial website was very limited, but we had plans to expand immediately. 

## Phase 2
The following month, we launched a significant expansion that included:
- Case, hospitalization, and death data by ZIP code
- Data by race/ethnicity and neighborhood poverty
- Data by age and other subgroups

NYC's data was some of the first in the nation that shows the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate effect on low-income communities and communities of color. 

## Post acute changes
After the first several months of the pandemic, the acute outbreak subsided. We realized that reporting cumulative data and daily data would have limited utility, so we began designing a new look that would separate the most recent data from the full trends. 

In August 2020 we launched the "Latest Data" page that looked at only the past 90 days of data. It also included tables that would give hyper-recent summaries of movements - designed to call attention to the first signs of a new wave of infections. 

Throughout the pandemic, the circumstances often changed, so we could revise what we were displaying and prioritizing in order to keep the focus on the most informative metrics of the moment.

## Service-oriented products
In 2020 and 2021, we developed a few key service-oriented components of this project.
- Data by ZIP: an interactive page that lets you enter a ZIP code and get data for that webpage. This was focused on helping people understand what was happening in their neighborhood.
- Screenreader accessibility. We worked with NYC's Digital Accessiblity Coordinator to understand accessibility issues better, and started designing and developing our data pages so that they'd be accessible and usable for people who use screenreader technologies.

## Successes
Our Communications parters told us that when the pandemic started, web traffic to the Health Department was 10 times higher than it was before the pandemic. And, early in the pandemic, half of that was to the data webpages. 

Traffic remained high through the pandemic - often mirroring the epi curve as new waves lead to renewed interest. At its peak, our charts were viewed 1,100,000 times per day.
