Over the past 10 years, I've done a fair amount of data-focused user research. Often this research was focused on a specific website or data product, but it winds up getting at a lot of the same questions around data-seeking. What do people want from data?

Often, the answer is: **so much more than a data point.**

I've heard these, in various ways, a lot over the course of my career. I'm still mulling over the ways to incorporporate these into data communication. It is a challenge! An important one. 

## The delivery of the data
- "It has to be easy to use."
- Machine-readable formats

## Framing the data
- The answer to the right question (policy vs neighborhood focus)
- The right comparison
- The why.

## What happens after the data
People want to know what they can do. This is difficult, especially working with city-wide or environmental data - it doesn't point to *individual* behavior change, and even focusing on individual behavior change is a red herrings. (Oh, so 100 years of disinvestment in housing is associated with huge disaprities in childhood asthma? "Here's how to manage asthma!" feels really defeatist and beside the point, doesn't it?)

But there are other ways to connect people to action - can they call 311? What laws and protections apply to them? Maybe they can contact their council person. Maybe there are city services that deal with this issue.
