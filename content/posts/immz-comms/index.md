In 2017 - 2018, I was the Communications Lead with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health Immunization Program. In this job, I did the following:

**Media campaign**. I lead development of a large media campaign for adult and childhood immunization campaign: developing strategy, designing billboards, and recording PSAs.

*School requirements robocall*: The school vaccine requirements changed, so over the summer, we had to reach nearly 200,000 public school students' families with info so that their kids could start the school year. We worked with schools and health care providers to distribute material and prepare, and we also sent this very brief robocall to every family with a child enrolled in public school. I wrote it and recorded the music and my coworkers' voices.

*Adult vaccines campaign*: We did a big PSA campaign about adult vaccines. This included these radio PSAs that I wrote and recorded, featuring the voice of a colleague.

And, we featured program staff in a billboard campaign designed targeting older adults with messages about how vaccines can help them stay healthy. We went for bright, cheerful colors and a youthful, active vibe.

**Re-designed print materials** . The Immunization Program - or "Immz" - provided vaccination support and mat√©riel to hundreds of health care providers in the city, distributing millions of dollars of federally-funded vaccine supply. This involved a lot of paperwork for providers. I lead a paperwork re-design, simplifying forms and instructions so that they would be easier for providers to fill out and easier for us to process.

**Re-designed website**: to improve usability for Philadelphia's immunizing health care providers, I lead a re-design of the website, focusing on top tasks, clear prompts, and easy access to the materials that providers used.  

**Registry re-branding**: As part of our website redesign and paperwork overhaul, we re-branded the Immunization Registry, from "The IIS" to "PhilaVax." Our design work included internal and external key informant interviews, focus group testing, and name and logo development.
