From 2013 to 2016, I worked with the Minnesota Department of Health in the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. I coordinated work on its Data Access Portal, working with epidemiologists, GIS professionals, and developers. 

This was my first experience working with web content about public health data, and I had something of a revelation. I reflected on my previous experience as a plain language health writer, and as a nonprofit proposal writer - both of these were about writing so that your audience would *do* something in response, either change a health behavior, or fund a nonprofit. I realized that design techniques played a role, too - and I learned about web usability and data visualization design. All of these overlapped in my head and I began to think about how web design, usability, data vis design, and plain language could all work together to create effective data communications. 

## User research
Early in my work, I convened user groups to conduct usability tests of the site. I was inexperienced with usability research, but read as much as I could and learned a lot from [Usability.gov](www.usability.gov). Over the course of many months, I convened several different groups and did a variety of usability tests.

The findings were incredibly valuable, and helped build a case that in order to make the most of our valuable data and information, we needed to have a functional design that supported the information. 

## Re-design
When I started work on the site, it was built in the department's standard page contexts, with confusing navigation. In usability tests, I watched users accidentally wander off into other sections of the department's website, not realizing that they had left "this system." This is a problem.

We felt it was important to delineate the borders of the site. Our re-design featured:
- A new logo and fresh Bootstrap theme developed in partnership with the department's communications staff and our developer
- Mobile compatibility
- Simplified navigation 

Additionally, to ensure that the content was in line with the new design, I developed and implemented new content standards: organizing information under headers and bullets, incorporating plain language summaries, and using message-focused visualiation techniques.

## County profiles
After a demonstration at a local department of health, one worker said to me, "I use the site to go get data for our county. That means that I go to one section, query the data, and pull the data for our county - and then I go to another section, query the data, and pull the data for our county. It would be great to be able to pull data just for my county." 

It was an "ah ha/of course!" moment. I began designing the County Profiles, worked with our in-house developer to develop them, and launched MDH's first county data profiles.

## Governor's award
Our program manager, Chuck Stroebel, submitted our program for a Minnesota Governor's Award in 2013 - and we won, [one of 6 recipients that year who created Better Government Services](https://mn.gov/admin/continuous-improvement/results/sga/). There was a gala at the statehouse. We met Governor Dayton, and on my way out I accidentally walked by [the fairly ridiculous portrait of Jesse Ventura](https://www.mnhs.org/capitol/learn/art/8912).
