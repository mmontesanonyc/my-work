## The groundwork
The site re-design started as a pilot in 2020, when we began re-building the Neighborhood Reports. First, we conducted a 6-month user research and user-centered design process, during which we conducted a survey, key informant interviews, and co-design sessions.

Then, we engaged a contractor to re-build the Neighborhood Reports using a static site generator, Hugo. A static site generator would let us build a secure, fast, flexible site that would let us pursue both internal develop and modular contracting, since it relies on fairly common, conventional technologies. 

## Choosing  technology
- Hugo
- NYC Core Framework
- Vega Lite
- Arquero

## Beginning in earnest
After taking receipt of the re-designed Neighborhood Reports, we began building the rest of the portal in earnest. 
- Our ported over content, building out our new site prototype. 
- We developed a new categorization scheme that would let us communicate how topics are interrelated
- We conducted a major content audit, reviewing all topic areas, and web copy in cooperation with our internal partners
- We learned Hugo, wrote templates and functions
- We conducted a major data audit, reviewing our datasets and their display needs so that we could write requirements and contract for the full development of our Data Explorer module 

## The new prototype
Here's what it features:
- A consistent style with the same navbar on every page to help show users where they are.
- A "related content" functionality that connects content based on core areas that we choose
- A "tags" functionality that connects content based on a looser set of keywords
- A new "Key Topic" area that connects resources across the other content types: Data Explorer, Neighborhood Reports, Data Stories, and Data Features.
- A good sitewide search.
- Major rennovations to the Data Explorer function:
    - Collapsing our 'topic' and 'indicator/visualization' pages
    - Ability to toggle between indicators
    - Improved UX on display options
    - Improved visualization

## Timeline and launch
The full prototype development took about a year:
- Summer 2021: begin Hugo development
- Fall 2021: 
- Winter 2022: begin contracting for remaining components
- Spring 2022: content and data audit
- July 2022: complete full site prototype
- August 2022: launch site
- September 2022 onward: ongoing iteration, development, and maintenance

The site is never *done*. We chose to re-design the site not as a milestone to reach, but a path to put us on: one that would allow us to do ongoing user research and user-centered design, frequent optimzation and experimentation, all with a platform that could give us full control over our product.
