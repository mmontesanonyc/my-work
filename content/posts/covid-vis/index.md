I spent 27 months activated with the Health Department's COVID-19 response. In addition to working on our agency's data communication, I provided a lot of data visualization support to other areas of the respose, including:

## Visualization for agency "white papers" and other reports
The agency periodically releases snapshot-reports to highlight some key findings. I contributed data visualization to several of these, including:
- ["Cityâ€™s COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign Has Prevented an Estimated 48,000 Deaths, 300,000 Hospitalizations, and 1.9 Million Cases"](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2022/covid-19-vaccination-campaign.page)
- [Post-vaccination Outcomes](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/covid-19-post-vaccination-data-082321.pdf).
- [Omicron report](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/omicron-variant-report-jan-13-22.pdf).

## Visualization for the Commissioner's social media
Commissioner Chokshi liked data and good data vis, and I was periodically asked to develop visualizations (and sometimes, tweet threads) for him to tweet.

[Here's one on a very cool paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136221000516) by Sharon Greene and others on reductions in hospitalizations following vaccination eligibility.  {{< imagemodal src="/COH-tweet.png" link="I adapted the paper's visualizations for a social media audience." caption="Reductions in hospitalizations following vaccine eligilibity." id="modalzip">}}

## Supporting our internal analytical dashboard
Early in the pandemic, the epidemiologists gathered to develop an internal analysis dashboard, and I provided support with initial wireframing, visualization, and UX support. [Read about this project here in Ngai, et al: "Built by epidemiologists for epidemiologists: an internal COVID-19 dashboard for real-time situational awareness in New York City"](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/5/2/ooac029/6582583?login=true).

## Trainings
I trained analysts and communications staff in data visualization design techniques, Github, and a few different data visualization platforms. 

One training, "Effective Data Communications: The what, the why, some silly jokes, literary references, and research, resources, and techniques to make your findings more easily understood and give your data greater impact" was particularly fun - mostly because of the silly jokes - and I wound up delivering it several times to to department analysts and a few CTSE groups. 

The talk frames data visualization as a communication problem, offers some key principles, and talks about how to apply them to chart. I also offered plenty of examples, and went through some before-and-afters.
