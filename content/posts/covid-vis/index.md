I spent 27 months activated with the Health Department's COVID-19 response. In addition to working on our agency's data communication, I provided a lot of data visualization support to other areas of the respose, including:

## Visualization for agency "white papers"
The agency periodically releases snapshot-reports to highlight some key findings. I contributed data visualization to several of these, including:
- [Post-vaccination Outcomes](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/covid-19-post-vaccination-data-082321.pdf).
- [Omicron report](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/omicron-variant-report-jan-13-22.pdf).

## Visualization for the Commissioner's social media
Commissioner Chokshi liked data and good data vis, and I was periodically asked to develop visualizations (and sometimes, tweet threads) for him to tweet.

Here's one on a very cool paper by [Sharon Green and others on reductions in hospitalizations following vaccination eligibility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136221000516). I adapted the paper's visualizations for a social media audience.

## Supporting our internal analytical dashboard
Early in the pandemic, the epidemiologists gathered to develop an internal analysis dashboard, and I provided support with initial wireframing, visualization, and UX support. [Read about this project here in Ngai, et al: "Built by epidemiologists for epidemiologists: an internal COVID-19 dashboard for real-time situational awareness in New York City"](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/5/2/ooac029/6582583?login=true).

## Trainings
I trained analysts and communications staff in data visualization design techniques, Github, and a few different data visualization platforms. 

One training, "Effective Data Communications: The what, the why, some silly jokes, literary references, and research, resources, and techniques to make your findings more easily understood and give your data greater impact" was particularly fun - mostly because of the silly jokes - and I wound up delivering it several times to to department analysts and a few CTSE groups. The outline was:

- Data visualization as a communication problem
    - A picture is worth a thousand words
    - Data communications encompasses strategy, design, and evaulation
- Key principles
    - Assume a hostile audience
    - Clarity and simplicity matter
    - Visualizations have a grammar
    - Information design standards and Gestalt Principles
- How these apply to charts
    - Plan
    - Have a main message
    - Simplify
    - Test and iterate
- Examples, before-and-afters
