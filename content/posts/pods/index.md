In the winter of 2021, I worked shifts at NYC's vaccination sites, the PODS. 

So much has changed during the pandemic that it can be hard to remember the precise feelings of different phases. But during the first few months of the vaccination campaign, things were intense. There was limited supply. Complicated and often-changing eligibility requirements. Difficulty booking appointments. Frustration. 

But there was also excitement - from the vaccinators, from the people waiting in the lines that wrapped around the block, from the staff. From the folks who hugged their vaccinator when the needle came out of their arm. From the family members who were there, too, cheering, crying, hugging. I don't think I'll forget those scenes. 

The first time I saw a shipment of vaccine being delivered to one of the sites, I started crying. It was hundreds of doses - all just in these little boxes - and to me, it felt like hundreds of lives saved.

I'm glad to have had the opportunity to help out with this work, even though it was only a small handful of shifts. I'm impressed and inspired by my colleagues who dropped everything else that they were doing to staff these sites. The 12-hour shifts, the weekend work, and the difficult commutes to far-away vaccine sites were a challenge for many, especially after nearly a year of emergency response work already. 

But they got it done.
