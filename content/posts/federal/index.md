While working with a health communications contractor, I lead work on health communications projects for federal clients. 

## Healthy People 2020
I lead a team of communicators and developers to maintain and develop [HealthyPeople2020](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020). Part of this work included leading design and development of new data communication functions like:

## Healthy People 2030
I lead a year-long user-research initiative with dozens of stakeholders to begin strategic planning for the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's decennial Healthy People initiaive - planning major improvements to services, web usability, and data delivery that would be implemented years later. This large formative research project included:
- An environmental scan
- In-depth interviews
- Co-design sessions
- A technological audit
- A usability audit

## Choose Safe Places for Childcare
Working with a contractor, I lead web presence and material development for Choose Safe Places for Early Care and Education, and environmental health initiative focused on child care safety. This work included:
- Key stakeholder interviews
- A comprehensive strategy and branding process
- Web development
- Developing material that would support their comprehesive safe-siting guidance manual.
