## About me

I am a public health professional and data communicator. I focus on making data:
- Easy to access
- Easy to understand
- Easy to use

Government public health agencies, entrusted with vast quantites of data about the public, create knowledge. This knowledge is public knowledge. It is our responsibility, and a matter of information equity, to deliver this knowledge so that people can use it.

To do this, I combine best practices from data visualization, data storytelling, health communications, and web usability to create web products, websites, and visualizations that inform, inspire, and engage.
