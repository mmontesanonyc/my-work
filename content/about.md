## About me
Currently, I am the Director of Data Communication in the Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. In this role, I:
- Lead work on the Environment & Health Data Portal
- Conduct user research
- Create new digital interactive web products

In this role, I've overseen a dramatic expansion of the EH Data Portal, launching a data stories initiative, designing a suite of interactive one-page data applications, and overseeing a major re-design and re-build of our full site. Synthesizing user research, health communications and usability research, I've translated findings into designs and products that make data easier to access, understand, and use.
