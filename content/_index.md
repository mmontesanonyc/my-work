Hi, I'm Matthew Montesano. 

I specialize in communicating public health data, leading teams that create informative, engaging, and successful data communication products. 

Government public health agencies, entrusted with vast quantites of data about the public, create knowledge. This knowledge is public knowledge. It is our responsibility, and a matter of information equity, to deliver this knowledge so that people can use it.

To do this, I combine best practices from data visualization, data storytelling, health communications, and web usability to create web products, websites, and visualizations that inform, inspire, and engage. 

When we do this, we make our agency's data - and our colleagues' findings - more influential, more likely to change policy, and more likely to save lives.
